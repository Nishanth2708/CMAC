1) Program a Discrete CMAC and train it on a 1-D function (ref: Albus 1975, Fig. 5) Explore effect of overlap area on generalization and time to convergence.
Use only 35 weights weights for your CMAC, and sample your function at 100 evenly spaced points. Use 70 for training and 30 for testing. Report the accuracy of your CMAC network using only the 30 test points.


2) Program a Continuous CMAC by allowing partial cell overlap, and modifying
the weight update rule accordingly. Use only 35 weights weights for your CMAC,
and sample your function at 100 evenly spaced points. Use 70 for training and 30
for testing. Report the accuracy of your CMAC network using only the 30 test
points. Compare the output of the Discrete CMAC with that of the Continuous CMAC.


3) Discuss how you might use recurrent connections to train a CMAC to output
a desired trajectory without using time as an input (e.g., state only). You may earn up to 5 extra homework points if you implement your idea and show that it works.
